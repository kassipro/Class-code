1. Which of the following can be implemented with lists?
  a. stacks
  b. queues
  c. sets
  d. maps

2. Consider the following class:
class A {
    public final List<String> strings;
    public A(List<String> s) { strings = s; }
}
  Can code outside the class change
  a. strings to a different list?
  b. the string at position 0 of strings to a different string?
  c. the char at position 0 of the string at position 0 of strings to a different char?
  For d, e, f, the same questions but for code inside the class

3. If I have an application where I want to look up student objects by their
   corresponding student ID's, which type of data structure should I use?

4. Why is binary search desirable?
  a. it's easy to implement
  b. it helps us keep data sorted
  c. it requires a small amount of work relative to the number of elements

5. Does binary search require the input to be sorted? Or is that just for performance?
