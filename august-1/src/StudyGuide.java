/*
1. Which of the following can be implemented with lists?
  a. stacks
  b. queues
  c. sets
  d. maps

2. Consider the following class:
class A {
    public final List<String> strings;
    public A(List<String> s) { strings = s; }
}
  Can code outside the class change
  a. strings to reference a different list object?
  b. the string at position 0 of strings to a different string?
  c. the char at position 0 of the string at position 0 of strings to a different char?
  For d, e, f, the same questions but for code inside the class

3. If I have an application where I want to look up student objects by their
   corresponding student ID's, which flavor of data structure should I use?

4. Why is binary search desirable?
  a. it's easy to implement
  b. it helps us keep data sorted
  c. it requires a small amount of work relative to the number of elements to search through

5. Does binary search require the input to be sorted? Or is that just for performance?

6. Name three recursive algorithms that you coded in lab.

7. Write the following classes (the interfaces are already written)
Node class
  * String and next (private member variables)
  * one and two arg constructor (one arg should call two arg)
  * getters, setters

interface IList {
    void add(String, int);
    void remove(int);
    String get(int);
    int size();
}

class List implements IList
  * protected Node head, private int size
  * zero arg constructor

class Deque extends List
  * void addFirst(String)
  * void addLast(String)
  * String popFirst()
  * String popLast()

interface IStack {
    void push(String);
    String peek();
    String pop();
}

class Stack extends Deque implements IStack

interface IQueue {
    void add(String);
    String take();
}

class Queue extends Deque implements IQueue

interface ISet {
    boolean contains(String);
    void add(String);
    void remove(String);
}

class Set extends List implements ISet
  * use protected member variable to efficiently implement method
    * private int positionOf(String)
  * use position of to implement the other three methods
